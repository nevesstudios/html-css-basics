        <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF. Halve 1 medium yellow onion, then cut into 1-inch thick wedges.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Season 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Place skin-side down in an unheated large cast iron skillet. Place over medium-high heat and sear undisturbed until the chicken skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 10 minutes.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Flip the chicken and sear until browned on the second side, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place 1/2 cup mayonnaise in a small bowl, add 1 envelope onion soup mix, and stir to combine.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Transfer the chicken to a plate. Add the onion wedges to the pan and cook, trying to keep them intact as much as possible, until light golden brown on both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add 2 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon paste and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Turn off the heat.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Dollop 1 tablespoon of the mayonnaise mixture onto each piece of chicken and spread all over with the back of a spoon. Return the chicken skin-side up to the pan, moving the onions around as needed so they aren’t covered by the chicken.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 7:</strong> Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the chicken not touching bone registers at least 165ºF on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop 1 medium bunch fresh chives until you have 3 tablespoons. Add 2 tablespoons of the chives and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt to the remaining mayonnaise mixture and stir to combine.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 8:</strong> When the chicken is ready, if you’d like a bit more color and crunch, turn the oven to broil and broil until well browned and the skin is crisp, about 2 minutes.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 9:</strong> Transfer the chicken to a plate. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to the pan and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom with the wooden spoon.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 10:</strong> Spread the yogurt mixture onto a large plate. Top the yogurt mixture with the onions and chicken. Pour the drippings in the pan over the chicken. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon chives.

        <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut 1 large lemon in half crosswise. Slice one half into very thin slices and remove the seeds. Reserve the remaining half. Pick the leaves from 1 small bunch fresh parsley until you have 2 tablespoons and coarsely chop. Drain 3 tablespoons capers if water-packed, or rinse them well through a fine-mesh strainer if salt-packed.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pat 4 salmon fillets dry with paper towels, then season on both sides with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Melt 2 tablespoons of the unsalted butter in a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon skin-side up and sear until golden-brown on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Transfer the salmon skin-side down to a plate (it will not be cooked through).
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add the lemon slices to the skillet in a single layer and cook, flipping halfway through, until fragrant and caramelized in spots, about 1 minute. Add 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth and 1/4 cup dry white wine and simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon half into the pan, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons unsalted butter and capers. Stir to combine and melt the butter. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Return the salmon skin-side down to the pan. Cook until the sauce is thickened and the salmon is cooked to desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest fillet should register 120 to 130°F for medium-rare, or 135 to 145°F if you prefer it more well-done. Garnish with the parsley before serving.

        <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Tenderize the pork chops with a fork.</strong> Place the pork chops on a large plate or baking sheet. (Optional — place a wire rack on a baking sheet.) Prick the chops all over with a fork, about 1/8 inch deep. Flip the pork chops and repeat pricking the other side.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Brine the pork chops.</strong> Place the water, salt, and brown sugar in a gallon zip-top bag and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Add the pork chops and seal the bag.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place the bag on a rimmed baking sheet and arrange so that the pork chops are sitting in a single layer. Refrigerate for 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Drain and pat the chops dry.</strong> Remove the pork chops from the brine and pat dry with paper towels.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> <strong>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and sear.</strong> Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot and just beginning to smoke. Add the pork chops and cook for 1 minute on each side — they should begin to brown and release some fat into the pan.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> <strong>Continuing flipping and cooking for 8 to 10 minutes.</strong> Reduce the heat to medium. Continue to cook for 8 to 10 minutes more, flipping the chops every minute, until they register 135°F in the thickest part.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 7:</strong> <strong>Butter baste off the heat.</strong> Remove the pan from the heat. Add the butter, thyme, and garlic. Use a large spoon to spoon the melted butter over the pork chops. Flip the pork chops and baste again. Let the pork chops rest in the pan until they reach 140 to 145°F, 5 to 7 minutes.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Slice and serve.</strong> Slice the pork chops across the grain and serve with the butter sauce.
